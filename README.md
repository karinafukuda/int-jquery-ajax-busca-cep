# int-jquery-ajax

Course :Introduction JQuery

For this mini-project you need to use: Javascript , HTML and public API <ViaCep> => https://viacep.com.br/ws/ for requisition.

I preferred to use CDN in this mini-project instead of downloading bootstrap and JQuery / Ajax. But you can download and save the file to your project by:

Bootstrap => https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/

JQuery and Ajax => https://jquery.com/download/
